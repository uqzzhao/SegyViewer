SEGY Viewer v1.5, which is a module from RockVisioner software, is a trace header and waveform viewer for both miocroseismic and surface seismic data in SEGY format.The full package of RockVisioner is an integrated microseismic and surface seismic processing and interpretation software developed by Rock Vision Solutions, Ltd.

Open SEG-Y Files:
Browse to the folder containing the SEGY files in *.sgy or *.segy formats and select a file to open.  All files with the same extension will be shown in the Segy Files listbox. You can also right click the system tray of this tool on the bottom right of your window to choose "Open" menu in order to open a SEG-Y file.

The EBCDIC header is shown on the left side of the tabbed sheet. You can check or uncheck the EBCDIC Header to swap text format if you see unreadable codes.

Volume Header:
Select a file from listbox, key information on samples, sample rate, total trace number, SEGY data format and revision information will be shown on the middle left while data type and byte are shown on the bottom left. 

Trace Header:
The table on the right shows trace header values, click on radio buttons to show the min and max value for each 2 byte and 4 byte header location.

Waveform:
To view the traces select the Waveform tab.  The traces are shown in wiggle mode and left to right. Both surface and microseismic traces can be displayed in the individual track on plot area above, while only microseismic data can be shown in X, Y, Z and 3C mode ordered by each geophone. You can click any one radio button to show any component of the microseismic traces of each geophone.

Tips:
Use your mouse wheel to zoom in and out the waveform and click the plot to pan.
Close this window or click Minimize to Tray button will hide this window, you can reopen this window whenever you click or double click the system tray on the bottom right.




Please note that the author does not promise any kind of support for these functions. 
However, should I happen to hear about a problem that illustrates an obvious bug (not a "feature") or that tickles my fancy I might do something about it and include the fix (or improvement) in the next release.
